fpsFBMSelect is a multiselect control based on jQuery.
The original idea of the control has been found on Facebook.

You may see the demo [right here](http://nukedukem.orgfree.com/fpsfbmselect/). The demo page is also included in the distribution package.

Here are some features:
  * user input of values can be enabled (system and user values can be saved in separate fields),
  * you can use dynamic variant loading with AJAX or local variant list,
  * adjustable pause before triggering AJAX request, so it won't be fired on every key hit,
  * no littering in namespaces, all names (in JS-code and in styles) start with appropriate prefix.

For documentation see the DocPage.

Please, report bugs and suggestions at the Issues Page.
